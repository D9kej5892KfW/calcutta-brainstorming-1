# Claude Agent Telemetry System

## Project Overview
A security audit system for monitoring Claude Code agent activities through structured logging and centralized dashboard visualization.

**Problem Statement**: As AI agents become more prevalent, there's a need to monitor and audit their behavior to ensure they operate within defined security boundaries and don't stray from their intended purpose.

**Solution**: Implement hooks-based telemetry collection with Loki dashboard for comprehensive agent activity monitoring.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Capture all Claude tool usage events (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- **FR-002**: Generate structured logs with context for each action
- **FR-003**: Support session-based and project-based activity grouping
- **FR-004**: Provide centralized dashboard for log visualization and querying
- **FR-005**: Enable post-incident forensic analysis of agent behavior
- **FR-006**: Scale to support multiple concurrent Claude sessions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Zero impact on Claude Code performance
- **NFR-002**: Handle high-volume log ingestion without data loss
- **NFR-003**: Support historical data retention for audit compliance
- **NFR-004**: Provide sub-second query response times on dashboard
- **NFR-005**: Maintain data integrity and tamper-proof audit trail

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack
- **Trigger System**: Claude Code hooks
- **Log Format**: JSON structured logs
- **Storage**: Loki (log aggregation)
- **Visualization**: Grafana/Loki dashboard
- **Transport**: HTTP/HTTPS for log shipping

### Log Schema
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-30T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "event_type": "tool_usage",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "project_path": "/home/user/webapp",
  "project_name": "webapp",
  "tool_name": "Read",
  "action_details": {
    "file_path": "/src/components/Button.jsx",
    "operation": "read_file",
    "size_bytes": 1024
  },
  "context": {
    "command": "/implement user-authentication",
    "persona": "frontend",
    "reasoning": "reading existing component structure"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "claude_version": "3.5",
    "superclaude_version": "3.0.0",
    "user_id": "jeff"
  }
}
```

### Hook Implementation
- **Location**: `~/.claude/hooks/`
- **Trigger Points**: Pre/post tool execution
- **Data Collection**: Tool name, arguments, file paths, context
- **Transport**: Local file write + log shipper OR direct HTTP to Loki

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Telemetry (MVP)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Hook captures Read, Write, Edit tool usage
- [ ] Generates structured JSON logs locally
- [ ] Basic log schema implemented
- [ ] Session and project identification working

### Phase 2: Log Aggregation
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Loki instance configured and running
- [ ] Log shipping from hooks to Loki working
- [ ] Basic dashboard showing tool usage over time
- [ ] Query functionality for filtering by session/project

### Phase 3: Enhanced Context
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Capture SuperClaude command context
- [ ] Include persona and reasoning information
- [ ] Add file content change tracking (diffs)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive tool coverage (Bash, Grep, etc.)

### Phase 4: Dashboard & Analytics
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Rich Grafana dashboard with multiple views
- [ ] Security-focused panels (unusual access patterns)
- [ ] Historical trend analysis
- [ ] Export capabilities for compliance reporting

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Coverage**: 100% of tool usage events captured
2. **Performance**: <5ms overhead per tool execution
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% log delivery success rate
4. **Usability**: Security incidents detectable within dashboard queries
5. **Scalability**: Support for 10+ concurrent Claude sessions

### Security Monitoring Capabilities
- Detect agents accessing files outside project scope
- Identify unusual tool usage patterns
- Track command execution that deviates from stated purpose
- Monitor file modification patterns for compliance

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Claude Code hooks system
- Loki log aggregation platform
- Grafana for dashboard visualization
- JSON parsing and HTTP libraries for log shipping

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Loki instance (local or cloud)
- Storage for log retention (size TBD based on usage)
- Network connectivity for log shipping
- Dashboard hosting environment

## Example Use Cases

### Security Audit Scenario
```
Query: Show all file access outside /src/ directory for session abc123
Expected Result: List of Read/Write operations with full context
Purpose: Verify agent stayed within assigned project scope
```

### Behavioral Analysis
```
Query: Tool usage patterns for user authentication implementation
Expected Result: Timeline of Read → Edit → Write operations
Purpose: Understand normal vs anomalous implementation patterns
```

## Future Considerations
- Real-time alerting for security violations
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Integration with external security tools
- Multi-tenant support for team environments
- Permission profile enforcement integration
